*None of the specified keys in the configuration are mandatory; they can be manage to fit specific needs or omitted as desired.*

### _Description

This key aims to provide a way to insert notes within the configuration JSON itself. The value can be whatever you want as long as the JSON remains valid.

### Hooks

- `category`: Acts as a filter in the devtools panel, helping you organize and identify the sinks.
- `type_X`: Specifies the type of sink you're targeting. The possible types are:
    + class
    + attribute
    + function
    + event
- `sink_X`: This denotes the name of the sink that needs to be hooked, the notation varies based on type:
    + `class` & `function`: Use the target name directly, such as `URLSearchParams`.
    + `event`: Only use the event name. For instance, for the `onmessage` event, simply use `message`.
    + `attribute`: Prefix with `set:` or/and `get:` as appropriate. An example would be `set:Element.prototype.innerHTML`.

### Config

- `sink`: Refers to the target sink to be configured. It's essential for this to be present in the hooks section.
- `match` || `matchTrace`: An array of regular expressions. The `parameters` || `stack trace` of the sink must respect to these patterns.
- `!match` || `!matchTrace`: An array of regular expressions that the `parameters` || `stack trace` of the sink should not match.
- `beforeEnter`: This key should contain a raw JavaScript function that will be executed before the sink itself (and before any DOMLogger++ checks). The function receives 3 arguments: `target`, `thisArg`, and `args`, all of which refer to the currently identified sink. For example, using `return [args[0] + '*2']` on `eval('2')` will result in `4`.
- `requiredHook`: Specifies a list of hooks or sinks that must be triggered at least once before the target sinks start logging information. An example of this can be found in the [leverage-innerHTML.json](./configs/leverage-innerHTML.json) configuration file.
- `alert`: Triggers an alert badge on the extension icon based on specific conditions.
    + `match` & `!match`: Additional regular expressions that the sink parameters must respect to or avoid, respectively, in order to trigger the alert.
    + `notification`: If set to `true`, a notification popup will appear when all conditions are satisfied.
- `showThis`: If set to `true`, the `this=` object will be logged in the context of a function call.

Since version `1.0.4`, it is now possible to use the `exec:` regex directive, which allows you to generate a regex from JavaScript execution. For instance: `exec:return document.location.pathname`.

*For more detailed examples and insights, please refer to the [configs](./configs/) folder.*

### globals

The content of this key will be accessible in the `domlogger.globals` variable. It is designed to facilitate the modification of specific variables used in the `exec:` or `beforeEnter` directives. An example of its usage can be found in the [cspt.json](./configs/cspt.json) configuration file.

### onload

This key should contain a raw JavaScript function that will be executed after DOMLogger++ has loaded.

### removeHeaders

Thanks to this key, you'll be able to provide a list of response headers (in lower case) that you want to remove if the remove headers feature is enabled. This is especially useful for removing security headers during tests.
